## Hardware
I have a [Samsung Galaxy A50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_A50) phone and a Thinkpad T16 with a 12th Gen Intel i7 processor and 32GB of RAM. I also have a [Rasberry Pi 1A+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-a-plus/) that I use as a server.

## Operating system
I use Windows 10 on my laptop, Android on my phone and [DietPi linux](https://dietpi.com/) on my server.
## Social Media
I don't use social media much but when I do it is Mastodon or occasionally Bluesky. I'm also on Instagram (because of network effects) but try to avoid it.
