title: The Carpenters are underrated (by me)
---
The Carpenters are one of those bands that I've listened to much of my life without really hearing them. 

My parents have one of their CDs and we sometimes listen to it when we are in the kitchen (which is also a dining room) together.

I recently listened to their self-titled album and - maybe because I was feverish at the time - I feel like I haven't before appreciated how good it is. The songs are complex and the parts fit together to make beautiful music whilst still being songs that you can sing along to.

I think this shows that sometimes we should look more closely at things we take for granted. You can find something unexpected and beautiful!
