This week I went hiking and wild camping on [Dartmoor](https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/) for 2 nights with my family.

It was really beautiful and empty - we barely saw any other people. As you go further into the national park the maps resemble reality less and we got lost a lot, particularly when trying to cross small rivers.

I would have used the opportunity to improve [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (which we used alongside [OS maps](https://osmaps.com/)) but I was honestly a bit too lost for that.

We spent much of the time with wet shoes (from the aforementioned rivers and the marshland around them). Next time I'm definitely bringing more socks.
