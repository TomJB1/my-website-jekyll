title: My UCAS personal statement

I recently applied to university for physics and thought that it might help someone to publish my [UCAS](https://www.ucas.com/) personal statement here - they can be quite intimidating to write so I guess that a real example might be useful.

Something to keep in mind when writing your own is that whe
n you go to submit your personal statement, as well as the 4,000 character limit (including returns) there is also a 47 line limit - lines break at 94 characters or new lines. I didn't know this and had to do last minute editing.

I have received offers from all 5 places that I applied, so I guess this should be a good example.

**Warning: Don't copy this verbatim because the universities definitely run applications through plagiarism checkers.**  Also read my [[2025-01-31-When galaxies collide|most recent physics piece]] on why I probably shouldn't have mentioned modified gravity. Above all write about what you are really interested in.

Hope this helps you if you are applying.

Also the "small website" is this one!
## My personal statement
I have always been interested in how things work and in the world around me. This has led me to enjoy physics. I read a lot from a young age and encountered physics in books by authors like Hawking, Rovelli and Cox. This interest prompted me to study physics at A level â€“ it has only grown and I would now like to continue studying physics at university.

As part of my A level course, I wrote a report asking if dark energy could explain the expansion of the universe. I researched theories such as the cosmological constant, the lambda-CDM model, quintessence and modified gravity. I concluded that dark energy is the most plausible explanation however I would be interested in exploring this subject further.

I have written an EPQ on the possible uses of quantum computing technology in the future. I chose this topic because it combined my interests in physics and computing and I wanted to understand quantum physics more. I used it to explore a range of potential uses such as cryptographic applications, uses of the technology in simulation and for solving optimisation problems using quantum annealing.

I found it interesting that superposition of qubits can be used to generate random numbers which are useful for encryption, this could lead to better security of encryption. Quantum key distribution systems could further make encryption systems more secure, whilst if quantum computers become powerful enough they could break conventional encryption, requiring the creation of a new form of quantum-safe encryption. There is potential for using it for simulating quantum materials such as multiferroics and superconductors which could be useful for a range of applications. Quantum computers could also be used to solve optimisation problems more efficiently using quantum annealing. I enjoyed researching this topic as it is a field in which new discoveries are being made all the time. Working on my EPQ helped me decide to apply to study physics at university.

I am a leader of the Astrophysics Society where I have presented on a variety of subjects. As part of this I have presented on exoplanets, their classification and how they are found using transit photometry and other methods. I have also presented on current and possible future methods of spacecraft propulsion such as ion, solar sails and nuclear pulse. Another subject I have presented on is cataclysmic variable binary stars and how they can cause novae and supernovae. This has helped me to develop leadership and teamwork skills as well as explore my interest in space.

I have taken opportunities to learn more about a wide range of physics topics such as the Oxford physics online masterclass, which was a day of virtually held lectures on subjects such as quantum computing, material science and problem solving run by Oxford University. I have also attended Physics in Action, a day of physics lectures in London and visited the Diamond light source synchrotron. I achieved gold in the British Physics Olympiad Senior Physics Challenge.

I enjoy coding in my spare time as well as in my computing A level and I have used online resources to learn a range of programming languages including C++, python and Golang. I have also coded a small website.

I also participate in a range of other activities. I have been a member of the scouts movement since I was 11 and I am currently part of an Explorers group as well as volunteering as a leader in the Scouts group. It allows me to participate in a wide range of activities such as walking, camping and learning new skills.

I enjoy tap dancing and have passed my grade 3 exam. I have also performed in a number of shows at our local theatre.

I have played the clarinet for many years and I am part of the Jazz Orchestra at school. I have played in many school concerts. I particularly enjoyed playing at my school's (REDACTED) festival, which was attended by many families and former students.

I hope to continue engaging in a range of activities at university.
