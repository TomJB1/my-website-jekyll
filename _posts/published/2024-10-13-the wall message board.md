title: the wall message board
---
I had a idea for a message board with only 10 messages on it. It sounded cool so I made it over the weekend in [Golang](https://go.dev/).
Visit [the website](https://the-wall.tombrandis.uk) if you want to check it out. 
I've released the [source code](https://github.com/TomJB1/the-graffiti-wall) on Github under the GPL-3.0 licence.

I'll don't really have anything interesting to say about this other than:
- no, this isn't my computing project 
- yes, I should have been working on my project instead.
