## Tools
[Tile-able Website Backgrounds](https://tiled-bg.blogspot.com/) - get images for a repeating background on a website.

[MAS](https://massgrave.dev/)

[X-Ray Goggles](https://x-ray-goggles.mouse.org/) allows you to see and edit the HTML of sections of a web page simply by clicking on them (you may need to temporarily disable XSS protections).
## Guides
[LandChad.net](https://landchad.net/) has lots of tutorials for self-hosting your own website and much more.

[ISPmail](https://workaround.org/) is a great guide to running your own mail server ([[2025-03-30-Self hosted mail and 20 posts!|as I do]]).
## Fun
[(non-)user events - computer-feeling](https://non-user-events.computer-feeling.xyz/) - cool grid thing with links.

[Culture Machine - Ben Christel](https://benchristel.github.io/tv/) - videos from youtube that you might not otherwise find, presented as a TV.

[23 Tales - The Literary Works of Beatrix Potter](https://23tales.netlify.app/) by [Bradley Taunt](https://btxx.org/) has 2 of 23 Beatrix Potter books, Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin, presented nicely as web pages. I assume the other 21 are planned?

[Lex's Games ](https://lex.games/) by [Lex Friedman](https://lexfriedman.com/) - daily games clearly modeled after the NYT games. I particularly like [Conlextions](https://lex.games/connections/) but the Mini is too hard for me.

[Animagraffs](https://animagraffs.com/) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnZeeKO8qVdtkrA4-uKhtTw)) by [Jacob Neal](https://jacoboneal.com)  has loads of intriguing and high quality animations about how things work such as [How Hover dam works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EdMImlZE2s).

[One Minute Park](https://oneminutepark.tv/) gives you a 1 minute video of a random park.
## Publications
[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php) is a web comic by [Zach Weinersmith](https://theweinerworks.com/).

[Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) curates and writes essays about works in the public domain that you might not have heard of.
## Social
[tilde.club](https://www.tilde.club/) is a shared Unix computer where you can get an account. Find me at [tilde.club/~tombrandis](https://tilde.club/~tombrandis/).

[/dev.space](https://slashdev.space/) provides free git hosting and a community to developers. I might move my git repos there at some point...
## Something else
[Photography in Malaysia](https://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/) doesn't seem to have been updated recently but is very interesting to look around.

[Out-of-Print Archive](https://www.outofprintarchive.com/news.html) preserves old magazines that are now out of print.
## More sites
[The Big List of Personal Websites](http://biglist.terraaeon.com/) is really rather big. I'm still making my way through it.

[Ye Olde Blogroll](https://blogroll.org/) - curated list of blogs.
## What's next?
Now that I have categorised all of these links, I'm considering creating a page for links.
