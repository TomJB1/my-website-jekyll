This morning I got an email welcoming me to [tilde club](https://tilde.club/). I applied about a week ago and they were quite quick!

Tilde club is a shared unix computer that anyone can get an account for. There are other tilde's but the one that I've joined has the tilde.club domain and I think it's probably the original one.

I've got a [tilde home page](https://tilde.club/~tombrandis/) page, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it yet but I'm sure I'll think of something.

I have also got [a tilde club email](mailto:tombrandis@tilde.club) which could be used as a backup if my self hosted email address goes down unexpectantly, which is great.
