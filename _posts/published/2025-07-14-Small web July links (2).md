## Tools
[Unsure calculator](https://filiph.github.io/napkin/) is a calculator that can handle uncertainties.

With [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.st/) unusable for new papers unless you use their cryptocurrency, Anna's archive's [SciDB](https://annas-archive.org/scidb) steps up with all the Sci-Hub papers as well as newer ones.

[Velvetyne fonts](https://velvetyne.fr/) - lots of open source fonts to use.

[Newsjunkie](https://www.newsjunkie.net/) has information about ownership of newspapers.
## Guide

## Fun

A detailed, hand drawn map of Middle Earth - [3rings](https://3rin.gs/).

[A tediously accurate map of the solar system](https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) if the moon was the size of one pixel. This is nicely made with funny comments along the way as you scroll through the emptiness of space.

Synthesise dynamic e-business and incubate end-to-end networks more effectively with the [Bullsh_t Generator](https://www.bullshitgenerator.com/).

[Dense Discovery](https://www.densediscovery.com/) is a weekly newsletter with a link to an article which is usually interesting. Get it [via RSS](https://www.densediscovery.com/feed/).

[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) is, apparently, "a webcomic of romance,  
sarcasm, math \[sic], and language". 
## Social
[SDF Public Access UNIX System](https://sdf.org/?welcome) is another computer that you can get an account on. It runs NetBSD rather than Linux and is one of the oldest that I have found, having started in 1987.
## Something else
[37 Heaven](http://thirty-seven.org/) - everything is 37.

[CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com/) shows off the many designs that can be created by just changing the CSS of a page.
## More sites
