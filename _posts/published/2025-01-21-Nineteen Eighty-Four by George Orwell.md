Yesterday, Elon Musk did a [Nazi salute](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/hitler-salute-hand-sign) to a crowd at Trumps inauguration. You can [watch it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/live/rahZ_CeEpqI?si=fyV8v_8jrG5iTdFi&t=30160) if you want. 

Or he didn't. Maybe he just raised an outstretched right arm with the palm down - saluting first the crowd and then the flag behind him - by accident.

Does it matter if Musk did that maybe-not-a-salute by accident or on purpose. White supremacists know what it means.

"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was
 their final, most essential command." - George Orwell, _Nineteen Eighty-Four_
