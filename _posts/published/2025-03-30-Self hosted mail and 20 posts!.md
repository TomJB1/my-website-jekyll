Anyone who reads my blog will know that [[2024-08-18-Don't google it|I don't particularly like Google]] to the extent of stopping using their monopolised browser/search engine however that was quite easy due to the [[2024-12-01-How to not google it anymore|multitude of great replacements]].

The two other parts of my life that are still entangled with the tech giant are storage and email. I assumed that I would tackle the former first - email seemed so complicated compared to other things that I had done like web servers - however last week I happened upon a guide that promised to take me through the steps to making a "fully-functional mail server". At the bottom of the page there was a long list of testimonials. I decided to try it.

The [ISPmail Guide](https://workaround.org/) is really good. It was much clearer than other instructions that I have failed to follow in the past. It only took me a couple of hours and a little bit of troubleshooting to get a mail server up and running on my Raspberry Pi 1 A+.

The setup seems reasonably robust and I can add other addresses - maybe some friends  or a organisation/company mail - if I want which is great.

My new email is [tom@tombrandis.uk](mailto:tom@tombrandis.uk). I love getting mail so don't hesitate to send some to me.

In other news I have made 20 posts here, containing just over 8,000 words! This is *a lot* for me - writing wasn't really my thing for a long time. I have also just (nearly) finished my 14,000 word computing project writeup, which was quite hard to do. That will be coming to the reports section soon (although I imagine that the only people interested in it will be other computer science A level students).

[[2024-12-09-Number 10|Ten posts ago]] I made a list of things that I wanted to do. They were:
- get into a university I like
- my own experimental search engine
- write a bit about the music I like
- write another essay-length piece

I haven't finished my A levels yet so I the first point is not achieved yet. I do have offers from some very nice universities though so I should be getting there.

The search engine is getting there but I haven't had much time to work on it. It will probably reach a version 1 some point after I finish my exams.

I have added the [music section](/music) to show music I like. I would like to add some more albums here.

I'm not working on a essay right now but I am attempting to write a guide to making a HTML web page for people who have never done so before with the aim of non-tech people being able to understand it. Right now it is longer than "[[2024-11-23-Is content destroying art|Is content destroying art]]".

Since then I have also made 102 commits to the site repo with improvements (or posts) including a [thank you page](/thank-you.html), made the post footers (hopefully) more semantic HTML, add a page to see [how much CO2 was in the atmosphere when you where born](/co2.html) and adding a new RSS feed with [[2025-03-28-Links via RSS|links from around the web]].

Here's to another great 10 posts,
