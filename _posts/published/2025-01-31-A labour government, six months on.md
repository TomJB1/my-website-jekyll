title: A labour government, six months on
previous_in_series:
---
A week or so ago, our current government passed 6 months in office. So how well have they done? I've definitely missed things - if you think that I have missed something particularly important maybe [send me some mail](mailto:tomjbrandis@gmail.com), I would be interested to hear your point of view. Now lets get into it.

<i>Update 30/03/25: My preferred email is now [tom@tombrandis.uk](mailto:tom@tombrandis.uk?subject=Response%20to%20A%20labour%20goverment%20six%20months%20on).</i>

## The good things
I'm going to start with all the best things that they have achieved.
- There is going to be [more funding for the NHS](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-funding-to-fix-the-nhs-heres-how-it-will-be-spent). Hopefully this will reverse the trend of worsening care or at least stop it collapsing. I've seen more people opting for private care and this creates a two-tier system for health that is quite worrying so this is definitely a step in the right direction.
- [The lifting of the effective ban](https://eandt.theiet.org/2024/07/09/labour-lifts-nine-year-ban-onshore-wind-farms) (where even one objection could stop a project) on onshore wind farms should encourage new energy sources to be more green.
- Not doing anything absolutely stupid that crashes the economy.
- [Real wages rising](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g372w32vjo) - this is more of an outcome than anything specific that they have done but definitely a good indicator.
Things that are announced but haven't started yet:
- [Free breakfast clubs](https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2024/11/free-school-breakfast-clubs/) will be rolled out in primary schools starting later this year, representing a return to supporting young people.
- ['Warm homes' grants](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/warm-homes-local-grant-a-guide-for-local-authorities/) starting in April to help low-income households access, better, lower carbon heating.
Some other bills that have passed the House of Commons haven't made it through Lords yet:
- The [Renters Rights Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3764) which is set to provide better protections to renters, which should make life better for the [more than a third of the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingenglandandwales/census2021) who don't own their home.
- [Removing undemocratic hereditary peers](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3755) from the House of Lords (hopefully they don't stop it from being passed).
## Not so good things
- Whilst they promised to ban new oil and gas in the North Sea, this [might not happen](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/UK-Government-Denies-Claims-Ed-Miliband-Has-Banned-New-North-Sea-Oil-Licences.html), I guess we'll see.
- Narrowing of eligibility for [winter fuel payments](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx02zdd92zdo), a scheme to help pensioners with paying for heating during the cold winter months. Ten million fewer people where given it this winter, almost certainly leading to preventable deaths.
- Continued corruption with Starmer accepting [huge amounts of gifts](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-starmer-accepted-more-gifts-than-any-other-member-parliament-sky-news-2024-09-18/) and corporate lobbying [getting even worse](https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2024/12/13/labour-corporate-lobbying/).
- Support of Israel despite [war crimes and genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide) in Gaza. 

## Conclusion
In the end despite the problems that I have with the current government they are still going in a direction that I like.
