title: Partial solar eclipse 2025

I saw a partial solar eclipse here in the UK today. I've been mostly avoiding the news in general recently meaning that I only found out about it about an hour before.

This was just enough time to follow the [pinhole camera tutorial from NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/resources/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/). It was a little cloudy but the projected image from the camera was still clear.

I was just in time to see the the sun be nearly-half-eclipsed by the moon. It got noticeably darker, although obviously not as dark as it gets during a full eclipse, which I would love to see at some point. 

All in all, very cool experience. Hope everyone who wanted to see it managed to (or will if you are later in its progression), I would have made a post before it as well but I didn't know.

And of course: *never look directly at the sun!*
