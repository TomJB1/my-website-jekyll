album_alt_text: Small words "Public Void" on a black background. Around it there is a outline with dots like it is selected in a text editing program. It has a drawing of a skull like a postage stamp in the top right.

Unique sound, really catchy and quotable - "I don't want to see the stars if they're just one more piece of land for us to colonize".
