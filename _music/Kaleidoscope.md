I find this album comfortable to listen to, although that's not to say that the songs are shallow - they definitely contain emotion. It is almost exactly half an hour long which is makes it useful for doing something for the length of it and also happens to be the length of my bus trip home.

_Hate My Guts_ is my favourite song in the album particularly for guitar in the empty space between the singing. I also appreciate the acoustic songs at the end of the album.
