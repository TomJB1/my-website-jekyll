Easily one of the best Green Day albums, it feels really cohesive as a album despite having a range of different songs.

A big part of this is the rock-opera story . It is much like the one in American Idiot but now we have two protagonists, the idealistic Gloria and the self-destructive Christian. Together they lead a revolution against religion. The album reckons with the  hate, anger and love that drive the revolution, the power and fire at the climax, and the lack of purpose of the revolutionaries afterwards.
