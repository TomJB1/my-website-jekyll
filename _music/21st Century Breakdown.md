album_alt_text: 'A black and white spray painting of a young man and woman kissing on a wall in black and white with a background that radiates from yellow to red like a fire. The words "Green Day" and the album title are spray painted on top. There is a "Parental advisory: Explicit content" sticker in the bottom left.'

Easily one of the best Green Day albums, it feels really cohesive as a album despite having a range of different songs.

A big part of this is the rock-opera story . It is much like the one in American Idiot but now we have two protagonists, the idealistic Gloria and the self-destructive Christian. Together they lead a revolution against religion. The album reckons with the  hate, anger and love that drive the revolution, the power and fire at the climax, and the lack of purpose of the revolutionaries afterwards.
