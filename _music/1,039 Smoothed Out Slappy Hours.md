This album is a collection of Green Day's oldest music. The style is quite different to their more recent songs but I really like it.  I often play it in the background - the songs have a good beat that is conducive to studying, or at least that is what I tell myself!

There is also a recording of an Green Day [playing some of these songs live](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHvbr8YG9A) on KZSU, the Stanford university student radio that is worth a listen if you like this era of their music.
