album_alt_text: Red love heart and blood droplet with "Love Drunk" cut out of it in a thin serif font. "Boys Like Girls" is above it in a blocky font. The background is a messy collage of blocks of shades of yellow and red.

Upbeat, light-hearted and optimistic. Like pop music but with enough variation that it's actually interesting to listen to.

Sounds like it should be the soundtrack to some teen drama.
